    <p>I am an experienced operations professional with a demonstrated history of finding elegant 
        solutions to complex problems. I have grown from a high-performing individual contributor 
        at a small startup, to hiring and managing a global team of eight at a publicly traded company. 
        I am passionate about constructing systems and processes to make data actionable for go-to-market roles.</p>
